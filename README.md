# robot_cleaner_small
Code for running a robot cleaner
Code is written for ESP32, but should work on Arduion Uno or nano, just need to get rid of the html_stuff. 
Warning when compiled from newping library is due to timing functions. Don't use any timing functions in newping library and you should be ok.
